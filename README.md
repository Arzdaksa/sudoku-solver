hey and welcome to my sudoku solver project

This project was my final project for the python course i took in my first semester in collage.
the algorithm took alot of time to finalize and to debug but after alot of trial and error i succeded at making it work.
In this project there are some saved sudoku boards that the algorithm solved and also there is a new randomm board created everytime the project is run.

have fun :)
